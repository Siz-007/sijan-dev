# While Everything Else Changed

This morning, a small thing made me pause.

A few weeks ago, while returning from the gym around 7 AM, I noticed a small hex nut on the road. Nothing special. Without thinking, I kicked it. Then kicked it again a few meters later. At one point it rolled toward the middle of the road and I abandoned it. It didn’t matter. I forgot about it the moment I walked past.

Today, while returning from the gym on the same road, I saw it again.

The same hex nut.

Maybe it had moved a few inches. Maybe cars nudged it, rain shifted it, time played with it slightly. But it was there. Weeks had passed. A new café had opened on the same corner. People had come and gone. Mornings had repeated themselves. And yet, that hex nut remained.

And for some reason, it felt like it meant something.

Not in a dramatic, universe-sending-a-sign way. More like a quiet nudge. A question that didn’t ask to be answered, only noticed.

It made me think about randomness.

We often say life is random. That things just happen. That meaning is something we impose afterward to feel better. And maybe that’s true. But standing there, walking past that hex nut again, I wondered-is life as random as we think, or even more random than we can comprehend?

Out of everything on that road, why did this stay? Why did I remember it? Why did my mind connect two separate mornings weeks apart using something so insignificant?

Nothing “happened,” yet something shifted inside me.

Maybe meaning doesn’t come from grand events. Maybe it comes from repetition. From memory. From noticing something small survive while everything else changes. The café is new. The road looks different. I am different. But that hex nut-pointless, quiet, unnoticed by everyone else-was still there.

And maybe that’s the unsettling part.

That life keeps moving loudly, while some tiny things just… remain.

I don’t know what it means. I don’t know if it means anything at all. But the thought followed me home. It stayed longer than the hex nut did in my awareness the first time. And maybe that’s enough.

Sometimes, clarity isn’t the point.
