# The Light They Forget

_Was it sorrow they carried,_\
_or just the silence they never learned to name?_\
_Was it the world that hurt them,_\
_or their own thoughts, louder than the world?_

_I sit at a cafe,_\
_watching the steam rise from a stranger’s cup -_\
_she looks tired, but there’s poetry in her eyes,_\
_and she doesn’t even know it._

_If only they looked at themselves from my eyes,_\
_they would see the way their laughter lifts the air,_\
_the way their footsteps write stories on dusty streets._\
_They would know they are beautiful -_\
_not in the mirror,_\
_but in the pause between their sighs._

_Most suffer more in imagination than in life -_\
_fighting battles that never arrive,_\
_sinking in tides that never touched them._

_But I’ve seen them._\
_I’ve seen how they pause at a flower blooming through concrete,_\
_how they hold the door for a stranger_\
_like it means something -_\
and it does._

_So I am writing for them,_\
_for the ones who forget they are light,_\
_and for the shadows they think they must become._
